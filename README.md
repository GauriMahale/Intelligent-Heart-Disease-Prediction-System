# Intelligent-Heart-Disease-Prediction-System

# Introduction 

1. It might have happened so many times that you or someone yours need doctors help immediately, but they are not available due to some reason.
2. The Heart Disease Prediction application is an end user support and online consultation project. Here, we propose a web application that allows users to get instant guidance on their heart disease through an intelligent system online.
3. The application is fed with various details and the heart disease associated with those details.
4. The application allows user to share their heart related issues. It then processes user specific details to check for various illness that could be associated with it. Based on result, system automatically shows the result specific doctors for further treatment. The system allows user to view doctorâ€™s details. The system can be use incase of emergency.
